# What is ROI?

ROI stands Return On Investment. It is a financial metric used to evaluate the
efficiency or profitability of an investment. ROI measures the amount of return
on an investment relative to it's cost.

The basic formula for ROI:

```
ROI = (Net Profit / Cost Of Investment) x 100
```

## What is Net Profit?

Net Profit in the context of a business, is the amount of money left over after
all the expenses, costs and taxes have been deducted from total revenue. It is
also called "Net Income" or "Bottom Line".

The basic formula for Net Profit:

```
Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
```

## Example:

Investing in a Food Truck Business

Initial Investment: $50,000

> This covers the cost of the truck, equipment, initial inventory and licenses.

After one year of operation:

Total Revenue: $120,000 \
Total Expenses: $90,000

Now, lets calculate Net Profit and ROI:

```
Net Profit = Total Revenue - Total expenses
           = $120,000 - $90,000 = $30,000

ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) x 100
    = ($30,000/$50,000) x 100 = 60%
```

Interpretation:

- Net Profit: The business generated $30,000 in profit over the year.
- ROI: The investment yielded a 60% return in one year.
