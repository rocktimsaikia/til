# Bismarck's Unification of Germany.

**Otto Von Bismarck** was a key figure in 19th-century German history. Before 1871,
what we now know as Germany was not a single country, but rather a collection of
independent states, kingdoms and principalities.

Bismarck, serving as the Chancellor (equivalent to a Prime Minister) of Prussia,
the largest and most powerful of these German states, orchestrated a series of
diplomatic, and military actions that led to the creation of the Unified German
Empire. He engineered the unification of Germany between 1862 and 1871.

## Key points:

### 1. Realpolitik:

Bismarck was mastermind of realpolitik, a pragmatic approach to politics based on
practical considerations rather than ideological principles.

### 2. Three wars:

Bismarck's unification consisted of three major wars:

- The Danish-Prussian War in 1864 (Denmark)
- The Austro-Prussian War in 1866 (Austria)
- The Franco-Prussian War in 1870-1871 (France)

### 3. The unified German Empire:

The unified German Empire was established in 1871, uniting 16 states under
Prussian leadership. "Blood and Iron (Blut und Eisen)" was Bismarck's famous phrase,
emphasizing the use of military power in the unification of Germany.

Bismark's unification strengthened Prussia's dominance, excluded Austria from
German affairs, and established Germany as a major European power. This transformation
profoundly impacted the balance of power in Europe and set the stage for future events
and conflicts.
