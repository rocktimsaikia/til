A **fascist** and a **dictator** are related but distinct concepts, often overlapping in historical contexts.

1. **Fascist**: This term refers to someone who adheres to **fascism**, an authoritarian political ideology \
characterized by dictatorial power, extreme nationalism, suppression of opposition, and control over various \
aspects of life, including the economy, media, and culture. Fascism typically glorifies the state or nation \
above the individual. Historical examples include Benito Mussolini in Italy and Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany.

2. **Dictator**: A **dictator** is a ruler who holds absolute power, typically through force or manipulation,
without being constitutionally accountable to the people or any other authority. A dictator doesn't necessarily
follow a specific ideology like fascism. They can rule under different political systems and
ideologies (e.g., communism, military juntas, or even personal autocracies).

In essence, **fascism** is a political ideology, while **dictatorship** refers to a type of leadership.
A dictator can be a fascist, but not all dictators are fascists. Fascist regimes are generally led by dictators,
but the term "dictator" applies more broadly to any absolute ruler.
