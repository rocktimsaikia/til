# Modulo 10: Always results in 0-9

```
(mod 10) â†’ [0-9]
```

That is correct. The modulo operation (`%`) with 10 as the divisor will always
result in a number between 0 and 9, inclusive, for any integer input. This property
makes modulo 10 useful for various applications such as **extracting the last digit
of a number** or creating cyclic patterns.
